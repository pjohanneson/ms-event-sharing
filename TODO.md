* TEC settings panel:
	* Allow automatic promotion (y/n)
	* If "n" to automatic promotion: Who has the say? (list of root site administrators + super admins -- checkboxes to allow one or more)

* Everything else, really, at this point
* successfully promoted event status needs to match source event (except publish if a) approval required & b) approval not granted) probably use post_status_transition (?) hook
